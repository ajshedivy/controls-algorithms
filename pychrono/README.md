# Control Sandbox

This is a sandox repo for the development of controls algorithms for autonomous vehicles by the Simulation Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The project utilizes a simulation framework called Chrono. Further details and information on Chrono can be found on the Project Chrono [website](http://www.projectchrono.org/). Additionally, the python wrapper for Chrono, [PyChrono](https://projectchrono.org/pychrono/), is used for demonstration purposes for some controllers.

#### PID

This a simple pid controller. The current demo utilizes a proportional and derivative gain. Independent steering and speed controllers are used.

#### MPC

Development in progress...

#### RL
