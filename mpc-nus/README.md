# Model Predictive Control

MPC controller/simulator from summer research work at NUS. See paper for algorithm details. 

To use, run mpc_accel.py or mpc_floorplan.py for different simulation environments/obstacle representations. Default is to display window and let user press 'q' to move through time steps (frame-by-frame). This is a flag that can be reconfigured in the code (could also be made into an argument if desired).
